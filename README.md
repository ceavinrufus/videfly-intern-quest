## Approach

1. **Design Slicing**

   - Sliced the desktop view design from Figma.
   - Exported all required assets directly from Figma.
   - Adjusted the styling for mobile and tablet views as there were no specific designs for these in Figma.

2. **Development**

   - Used version control (Git) for collaboration and tracking changes.

3. **Deployment**

   - Hosted the application on GitHub Pages.
